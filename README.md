# nba_season_stats_visualization

The goal of this project is to use SQL, Apache Superset, and Tableau to create data visualizations/analysis concerning NBA teams/players over the past 10 seasons. [NBA API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) and [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) are used to extract NBA data. **This is an ongoing project** that will be updated over time. As such, this README is a barebones version of the final iteration.

- `0_collection`: extracts the majority of the raw data needed to make SQL relational database
- `1_processing`: processes raw data into SQL tables
- `2_sql_creation_querying`: creates, populates, and queries SQL database
- `data`: holds the JSON/CSV files collected for the SQL database
- `main_0_1.py`: runs scripts located in 0_collection and 1_processing
