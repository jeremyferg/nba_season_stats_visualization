# nba_season_stats_visualization

The goal of this project is to use SQL and Tableau to create data visualizations/analysis concerning NBA teams/players over the past 10 seasons. [NBA API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) is used to extract NBA data. **This is an ongoing project** that will update with time. As such, this README is a barebones version of the final iteration.

- 0_collection: extracts the majority of the raw data needed to make SQL relational database
- 1_processing: processes raw data into SQL tables
